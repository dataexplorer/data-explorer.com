        Data Explorer is a free open-source interactive data-visualization tool for everyone.  It allows you to explore your data in highly interactive ways.
        It is a simple, yet powerful, tool for exploratory data analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using a simple and intuitive user interface, the software reduces the barrier of entry for the general population to perform light-weight exploratory data analysis.
        The hope is that this software, and a community of like-minded individuals, will help increase data literacy within our society as a whole.

        The software was initially released to the public in April 2014.  It is currently in development and will be updated quarterly.
